# Surf Ski 16

Surf_Ski_16, is a remake for CSGO, of the great [Surf_Ski_2](https://gamebanana.com/maps/149561) map, made by 'Super Mario' for Counter Strike 1.6.
The remake was made using [Valve Hammer](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor) and [VTFEditor](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VTFEdit) and is fully supported by CS:GO
The map still contains Super Mario's credits, alongside my newly added ones, as the remaker

## Usage

To install the map on your server/local files, simply download the most recent release- a single BSP file, and throw it in your CSGO maps folder. `Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\maps`.
## Terms of Use

Feel free to use the map on all your servers and for as long as you want:) but please follow the MIT License by leaving the copyright texts which are on some of the map's textures. For me and for the great Super Mario
